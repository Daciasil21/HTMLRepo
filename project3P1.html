	<h3>We serve the most delicious breakfast food you will ever find!</h3>
		<p>Established in 2002, The Breakfast Restaurant is a contemporary cafe that appeals even to the pickiest eaters (that means you?). Whether you want eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, cereal or just a regular cup of coffee, we've got it all.</p>
		<p>We are passionate about excellence, and we have a desire to serve you with consistent quality you won't find anywhere else.</p>
		<p>We want you to feel at home. You can expect to find a level of comfort and warmth from our nicely decorated dining area. We have comfortable chairs, old fashioned wooden tables, and other wonderful aspects that are simply nowhere else. We even have a patio area for our guests who need a little sunshine in their lives.</p>
