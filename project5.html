	<h1>Oh, so you're a programmer now, huh?</h1>
		<p>Welcome to programming, the most lucrative career in the world</p>
	
		<p>Being a programmer means you have opened up a whole new world of possibilities. Instead simply being a passive seer of technology, you are now a creator. You can create your own websites, social networks, mobile apps, and even games. You have the ability to create systems and environments that can reach potentially millions of people online. No other time in human history has such a thing been possible. We are truly living in the future, my friends, and I am happy you are a part of it. </p>
	
		<p>Here are some benefits of being a programmer</p>
